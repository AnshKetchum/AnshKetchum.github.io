I am a Member of Technical Staff at Zyphra Technologies, connecting hardware from emerging accelerators to novel foundational model architectures and helping improve performance at the pretraining and inference stages for our foundational models. My interests lie in how we can build, train, and serve foundational models that can better capture human intelligence, and then design performant hardware accelerators through the principles of software/hardware co-design.

I'm always interested in technologies that are related to AI and hardware! Have any cool ideas? Reach out - I'd love to hear them!
