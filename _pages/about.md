I am a graduating, 4th-year undergraduate student with a passion to explore the depths of artificially intelligent models, and understanding them as a whole. Currently, I serve as a Member of Technical Staff at Zyphra Technologies, connecting hardware from emerging accelerators to novel foundational model architectures and helping improve performance at the pretraining and inference stages for our foundational models. My interests lie in how we can build, train, and serve foundational models that can better capture human intelligence, and then design performant hardware accelerators through the principles of software/hardware co-design.

I'm always interested in technologies that are related to AI and hardware! Have any cool ideas? Feel free to share them with me at the email, or any of the other social network links on this page!
