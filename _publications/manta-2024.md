excerpt: 'The presiding model generation algorithms rely on simple, inflexible adapter selection to provide personalized results. We propose the model-adapter composition problem as a generalized problem to past work factoring in practical hardware and affordability constraints, and introduce MANTA as a new approach to the problem. Experiments on COCO 2014 validation show MANTA to be superior in image task diversity and quality at the cost of a modest drop in alignment. Our system achieves a 94% win rate in task diversity and a 80% task quality win rate versus the best known system, and demonstrates strong potential for direct use in synthetic data generation and the creative art domains.'
