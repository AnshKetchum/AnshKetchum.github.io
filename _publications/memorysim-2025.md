title: "MemorySim: An RTL-level, timing accurate simulator model for the Chisel ecosystem"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-5-01-memorysim
excerpt: 'We introduce MemorySim, a RTL-level memory simulator that strives to provide accurate timing simulations of memory systems while retaining correctness. The simulator is designed to be integrated into existing RTL-level simulations written in Chisel or Verilog. It’s also compatible with the Chisel / Chipyard ecosystem, allowing users to obtain highly accurate representations of performance and power through direct integration downstream leverage of simulation tools such as FireSim.'
