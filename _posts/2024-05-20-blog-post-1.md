## Summary 

In Berkeley’s tapeout course, our four-person team built a convolution accelerator from scratch — going from idea to silicon in just 15 weeks. We designed it to speed up 3×3 convolution operations using a custom multiply-accumulate pipeline integrated into the RISC-V Chipyard ecosystem. Working with evolving tools and minimal documentation forced us to rely on “tribal knowledge” and rapid iteration. After battling integration challenges and timing issues, our accelerator — BearlyML 24 — achieved up to 150× speedups in simulation and around 65× on real silicon. This chip ended up being demod to Apple. Seeing our design run successfully on hardware was the perfect ending to a fast, chaotic, and deeply rewarding project.
